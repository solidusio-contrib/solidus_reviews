Straightforward review/rating functionality, updated for [Solidus](https://solidus.io).

While the gem's name has changed, the module namespace and commands are still `spree` for now.

## Installation

Add solidus_reviews to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_reviews'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bin/rails generate solidus_reviews:install
```

## Usage

The `Spree::ReviewsController` controller provides all the CRUD functionality for product reviews.

The `Spree::FeedbackReviewsController` allows user to express their feedback on a specific review.
You can think of these as meta-reviews (e.g. the classic "Was this useful?" modal).

You can approve, edit and delete reviews and feedback reviews from the backend.

## Development

### Testing the extension

First bundle your dependencies, then run `bin/rake`. `bin/rake` will default to building the dummy
app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using
`bin/rake extension:test_app`.

```shell
bin/rake
```

To run [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis run

```shell
bundle exec rubocop
```

When testing your application's integration with this extension you may use its factories.
You can load Solidus core factories along with this extension's factories using this statement:

```ruby
SolidusDevSupport::TestingSupport::Factories.load_for(SolidusReviews::Engine)
```

### Running the sandbox

To run this extension in a sandboxed Solidus application, you can run `bin/sandbox`. The path for
the sandbox app is `./sandbox` and `bin/rails` will forward any Rails commands to
`sandbox/bin/rails`.

Here's an example:

```
$ bin/rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.0.2.1 application starting in development
* Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```
